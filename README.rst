Helpers for personal plotting of official SARS-COVID-19 data
============================================================

This is a personal project to visualise the daily official numbers. There are always undetected cases. Not being a domain expert, I do not provide interpretation or anything beyond most simple transformations of the data. I provide this code because might be helpful for others for their personal use. Currently there are plots for regional counts with a logarithmic y-axis and an animation on the world map. Please keep in mind that the amount of testing may vary between countries as well as over time.
