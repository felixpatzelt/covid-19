Helpers for personal plotting of official COVID-19 data
============================================================

This is a personal project to visualise the daily official numbers. There are always undetected cases. Please keep in mind that data collection methods may vary between countries and over time. Not being a domain expert, I do not provide interpretation or anything beyond most simple transformations of the data. I provide this code because might be helpful for others for their personal use. Currently there are plots for regional counts with a logarithmic y-axis and an [animation on the world map](map_animation.mp4).
